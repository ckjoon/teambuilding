Team Building Application for Junior Design

## Build and run
Ensure that you are using python 3 as well as pip3 and have virtualenv configured
to work with these versions.

CD into the repository and create a virtual environment using `virtualenv env`. 
Then run the command `source env/bin/activate` to move into your virtual environment.
Install all the dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. Start the server using `python3 index.py`.
